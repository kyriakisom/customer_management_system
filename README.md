The project is designed for easy deployment using Docker and Kubernetes, making it suitable for scalable and cloud-native environments.

# how_to_run
Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:
•	- .NET 6+ SDK
•	- Docker
•	- Docker Compose
•	- (Optional) MongoDB Compass for database visualization

🔐 Create .env File
Before running the application, you must create a `.env` file in the root directory. This file will contain your MongoDB credentials and must not be committed to version control.
Example `.env` file content:

MONGO_PASSWORD=<your_admin_password>

🐳 Running the Application with Docker Compose
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-management.git
cd customer-management
2. Build and start the containers:
docker-compose up --build
3. Access the API at:
http://localhost:8080
4. Access the MongoDB instance at:
mongodb://admin:supersecret@localhost:27017

🛑 Stopping the Application
To stop the running containers, use the following command:
docker-compose down

📝 Notes
- Do NOT upload the `.env` file to GitHub or any public repository.
- Make sure to update the Docker image and Kubernetes manifests if you change the project structure.
